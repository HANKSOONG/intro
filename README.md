# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hank Song

I'm a Master's student in AI, with a focus on **data science**, **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **language models**. 

I enjoy building pipelines that *actually work* ‚Äî whether that's benchmarking DINOv2 on CIFAR, restoring blurry images, or fusing human traits across video, text, and audio.

##  Selected Projects

-  [Charisma Predictor](https://github.com/HANKSOONG/Charisma-Predictor): Predicts personality & charisma scores via multi-modal fusion (video, audio, text). Achieved 92.5% accuracy using custom ensemble logic.
-  [MiniVision](https://github.com/HANKSOONG/MiniVision-Lightweight-and-Transformer-Models-for-CIFAR): Benchmarks ResNet, EfficientNet, DINOv2 on CIFAR-10&100. ViT reached 98.7% & 91.5% accuracy.
-  [Image Restoration](https://github.com/HANKSOONG/Image-Restoration): DnCNN vs. NAFNet on GOPRO/RealBlur with metric + perceptual analysis
-  [Image Stitching](https://github.com/HANKSOONG/Image-Stitching): Harris + SIFT + RANSAC full classical CV pipeline
